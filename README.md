# Spool Holder for 3D Printing

Simply print twice and put a threaded rod of the desired length through, and fasten with nuts, and you have a generic spool holder. By default it's 150mm tall, 120mm wide, 20mm deep at the base and 7mm at the top, has 4mm thick walls and takes 8mm rods. All of it can be customized by changing variables in the the SCAD file.
